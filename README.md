Robotics Club Summer Project tasks <br>
I have attached task 2 and task 6 for Mechanical turk. <br>
Please read this, <br>
I have a idea for picking pieces, we will construct a cube like frame above chess board with board as base for the frame. <br>
1.Now we will have a magnetic picker or a mechanical grabber attached to the top part of the frame movable throughout the squares. with the help of CNC, we will be able to pick pieces accurately
 <br>
 or
  <br>
2.we will drop a cage like structure from the top covering the square from top, left right front back. and we will move the cage shuch that the piece inside also moves with it. we can use path finding algorithms to find a path which does not collide with other pieces but you can move horse like that ^_^.
