<h1>TASK 2</h1>
<h2>Mechanical Turk</h2>
The most intresting thing i found about the project was, how we will be moving the selected piece accurately without disturbing other pieces. I came up with different ideas to move the piece such as arm, magnetic picker, etc. but none of them are feasable.
to pick the piece, we need CV to recogonise the piece but as per problem statement we should not use CV. also i am wondering how api(Mostly <a href = "https://stockfishchess.org">stockfish</a>) integration will be done with aurdino/esp32, will we be hosting or connecting a server to access the api?
